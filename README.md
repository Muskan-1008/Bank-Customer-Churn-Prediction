# Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction

Here I build the model to predict churn rates

At first I performed Exploratory Data Analysis,Feature Engineering,Feature Scaling,Feature Selection on dataset.And then solved the imbalance in dataset

I applied Following Models:

1)Naive Bayes Classifier

2)Decision Tree Classifier

3)Random Forest Classifier

4)xgboost Classifier

5)Logistic Regression


I found out that Naive Bayes was performing well with high recall and high ROC-AUC Score of 0.80
