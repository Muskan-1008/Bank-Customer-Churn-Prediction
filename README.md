# Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction

Here I build the model to predict churn rates

At first I performed Exploratory Data Analysis,Feature Engineering,Feature Scaling,Feature Selection on dataset.And then solved the imbalance in dataset

I applied Following Models:

1)Naive Bayes Classifier

2)Decision Tree Classifier

3)Random Forest Classifier

4)xgboost Classifier

5)Logistic Regression


Xgboost outperformed with high roc-auc score
